 ### About Me
 I am full stack web developer and my outstanding skill is frontend development. My expertise in this
area includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with advanced JavaScript such as React Js and related
libraries, as well as advanced skills in backend development, developing and providing solutions for
technical complexity. In addition, I have upper intermediate knowledge of databases. Since May 2020,
I've been a full stack developer at my current job and after one year of hard work, I've been promoted
to be a development team lead.
